# Q: Do I need this?

This repository is intended for *software developers* who wish to modify the [Farmbot Web App](http://my.farmbot.io/). **If you are not a developer**, you are highly encouraged to use [the publicly available web app](http://my.farmbot.io/). Running a server is a non-trivial task which will require an intermediate background in Ruby, SQL and Linux system administration.

If you are a developer interested in contributing or would like to provision your own server, you are in the right place.

# Q: What is the Farmbot Web API?

This Repo is the RESTful JSON API for Farmbot. This includes things like storage of user data, plant data, authorization tokens and a variety of other resources.

The key responsibility of the API is *information and permissions management*. This should not be confused with device control, which is done via [MQTT](https://github.com/FarmBot/mqtt-gateway).

# Q: Can I see some example API requests?

For a list of example API requests and responses, see our [reference documentation](https://gist.github.com/RickCarlino/10db2df375d717e9efdd3c2d9d8932af). If you wish to write an add-on application that uses the FarmBot API, please let us know in an issue. We are happy to answer any specific questions you may have.

# Q: How do I Setup an API locally?

## Prerequisites

Your machine will need the following:

 0. A Linux of Mac based machine. We do not support windows at this time.
 0. [Ruby 2.3.3](http://rvm.io/rvm/install)
 1. [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) (`brew install imagemagick` (Mac) or `sudo apt-get install imagemagick` (Ubuntu))
 2. [Node JS > v6](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 3. [`libpq-dev` and `postgresql`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6040583/cant-find-the-libpq-fe-h-header-when-trying-to-install-pg-gem/6040822#6040822)

### Setup

 0. `git clone https://github.com/FarmBot/Farmbot-Web-API`
 0. `cd Farmbot-Web-API`
 0. [Install `libpq-dev` and `postgresql`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6040583/cant-find-the-libpq-fe-h-header-when-trying-to-install-pg-gem/6040822#6040822)
 0. `bundle install`
 0. **MOST IMPORTANT STEP**. Copy `config/database.example.yml` to `config/database.yml`. In GNU/Linux or Mac: `mv config/database.example.yml config/database.yml`. **Please read the instructions inside the file. Replace the example values provided with real world values.**
 0. Give permission to create a database*
 0. `rake db:create:all db:migrate db:seed`
 0. (optional) Verify installation with `RAILS_ENV=test rake db:create db:migrate && rspec spec`.
 0. `MQTT_HOST=your_mqtt_server_domain rails s -b 0.0.0.0` where `your_mqtt_server_domain` is the IP or domain name of the MQTT server (see next step). The MQTT server does not need to be running yet.
 0. Now that the API server is running, [provision an MQTT server](https://github.com/FarmBot/mqtt-gateway).
 0. (REQUIRES NODE JS > v6) Run `./install_frontend.sh` to build the latest frontend app. You may also run the frontend on a seperate server. The [frontend repository](https://github.com/FarmBot/farmbot-web-frontend) has more info on this if you wish to do so. For most users, `./install_frontend.sh` should be sufficient.
 0. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The application is now ready for use.
 0. [Raise an issue](https://github.com/FarmBot/Farmbot-Web-API/issues/new?title=Installation%20Failure) if you hit problems with any of these steps.

\*Give permission to `user` to create database:
```
sudo -u postgres createuser user
sudo -u postgres psql
ALTER USER "user" WITH SUPERUSER;
```

# Q: Is Dokku / Docker supported?

Doku (a Docker management system) is partially supported. Pull requests welcome. Please see `deployment.md` for more information.

# Config Settings (important)

We try our best to follow the [12 Factor Methodology](https://12factor.net/). Part of that means using ENV variables as a means of [storing configuration](https://12factor.net/config). **Your server won't run without setting ENV variables first**.

You can accomplish this by setting the ENV variables directly from your shell / server management tool or by writing an `application.yml` file.

See `config/application.example.yml` for a list of all the variables that must be set.

**Encryption keys**: Encryption keys will be autogenerated if not present. They can be reset using `rake keys:generate`. If `ENV['RSA_KEY']` is set, it will be used in place of the `*.pem` files. Useful for environments like Heroku, where file system access is not allowed.

**We can't fix issues we don't know about.** Please submit an issue if you are having trouble installing on your local machine.

# Q: How can I Generate an API token?

You must pass a `token` string into most HTTP requests under the `Authorization: ` request header.

Here's what a response looks like when you request a token:

```json
{
    "token": {
        "unencoded": {
            "sub": "test123@test.com",
            "iat": 1459109728,
            "jti": "922a5a0d-0b3a-4767-9318-1e41ae600352",
            "iss": "http://localhost:3000/",
            "exp": 1459455328,
            "mqtt": "localhost",
            "bot": "aa7bb37f-5ba3-4654-b2e4-58ed5746508c"
        },
        "encoded":
        // THE IMPORTANT PART IS HERE!!:
         "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ0ZXN0MTIzQHRlc3QuY29tIiwiaWF0IjoxNDU5MTA5NzI4LCJqdGkiOiI5MjJhNWEwZC0wYjNhLTQ3NjctOTMxOC0xZTQxYWU2MDAzNTIiLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi8vbG9jYWxob3N0OjMwMDAvIiwiZXhwIjoxNDU5NDU1MzI4LCJtcXR0IjoibG9jYWxob3N0IiwiYm90IjoiYWE3YmIzN2YtNWJhMy00NjU0LWIyZTQtNThlZDU3NDY1MDhjIn0.KpkNGR9YH68AF3iHP48GormqXzspBJrDGm23aMFGyL_eRIN8iKzy4gw733SaJgFjmebJOqZkz3cly9P5ZpCKwlaxAyn9RvfjQgFcUK0mywWAAvKp5lHfOFLhBBGICTW1r4HcZBgY1zTzVBw4BqS4zM7Y0BAAsflYRdl4dDRG_236p9ETCj0MSYxFagfLLLq0W63943jSJtNwv_nzfqi3TTi0xASB14k5vYMzUDXrC-Z2iBdgmwAYUZUVTi2HsfzkIkRcTZGE7l-rF6lvYKIiKpYx23x_d7xGjnQb8hqbDmLDRXZJnSBY3zGY7oEURxncGBMUp4F_Yaf3ftg4Ry7CiA"
    }
}
```

**Important:** The response is provided as JSON for human readability. For your `Authorization` header, you will only be using `data.token.encoded`. In this example, it's the string starting with `eyJ0eXAiOiJ...`

## Via CURL

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"user":{"email":"test123@test.com","password":"password123"}}' \
     https://my.farmbot.io/api/tokens
```

## Via JQuery

Since the API supports [CORS](http://enable-cors.org/), you can generate your token right in the browser.

Here's an example:

```javascript
$.ajax({
    url: "https://my.farmbot.io/api/tokens",
    type: "POST",
    data: JSON.stringify({user: {email: 'admin@admin.com', password: 'password123'}}),
    contentType: "application/json",
    success: function (data) {
                 // You can now use your token:
                 var MY_SHINY_TOKEN = data.token.encoded;
             }
});
```
